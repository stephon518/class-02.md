**Basics of HTML, CSS & JS**

**HTML**

HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

X They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

**CSS**

CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

-Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).

-Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

-Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

-CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.


**Java Script** 

A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.

Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.

Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.

Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).

Expressions evaluate into a single value. Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

**Statements**

Statement- A scripts a series of instructions that a computer can follow. Each direction or step is a statement. Statements should end in a semicolon(;) Each Statement should start on a new line and stops in a semicolon (;), and it tells JavaScript when a step is over. Statements can be organized into Code blocks {}, which are not followed by a semicolon.

Example of a Statement

var today = newDate
Always write comments in your code to explain what your system does. Comments make your code easier to read and understand to others who read it.
